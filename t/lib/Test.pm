=head2 dies

  dies(sub {...}, $regex_expected_error, $msg)

Tests that the given coderef (most probably a closure) dies with the
expected error message.

=cut

sub dies {
	my ($coderef, $regex, $msg) = @_;
        eval {$coderef->()};
        my $exception = $@;
	Test::More::ok($exception =~ $regex, 
                       $msg || "dies with exception: $exception");
}



=head2 @CALL_FUNCS

The exported array C<@CALL_FUNCS> contains a list of coderefs
for testing several ways of calling driver-private methods.
On DBI versions prior to 1.608, such methods were called
through "func". Starting from 1.608, methods should be installed
within the driver (see L<DBI::DBD>) and are called through
C<< $dbh->sqlite_method_name(...) >>. This array helps to test
both ways. Usage :

  for my $call_func (@CALL_FUNCS) {
    my $dbh = connect_ok();
    ...
    $dbh->$call_func(@args, 'method_to_call');
    ...
  }

On DBI versions prior to 1.608, the loop will run only once
and the method call will be equivalent to 
C<< $dbh->func(@args, 'method_to_call') >>.
On more recent versions, the loop will run twice;
the second execution will call
C<< $dbh->sqlite_method_to_call(@args) >>.

The number of tests to plan should be adapted accordingly.
It can be computed like this :

  plan tests => $n_normal_tests * @CALL_FUNCS + 1;

The additional C< + 1> is required when using
L<Test::NoWarnings>, because that module adds 
a final test in an END block outside of the loop.
