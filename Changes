1.19_06 Sat  4 Apr 2009
    - Fixed a segv with an error function under x86 linux
      (and hopefully Mac OSX). (TOKUHIROM)
    - Fixed yet another segv while testing DBIC reconnection (DMAKI)
    - Switched from Test.pm to Test::More (though there're still
      some tests that don't use Test::More) (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added "use strict" to some. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Added a cleanup block to each test to allow it run clean and
      separately. (ISHIGAKI)
    - Adding an explicit minimum Perl version to the Makefile.PL (ADAMK)
    - Setting configure_requires dependencies for File::Spec
    - Splitting the LICENSE key into it's own MakeMaker
      version-dependency conditional (ADAMK)
    - All tests run under the same Perl environment
      (autoflush on, and warnings enabled via $^W = 1) (ADAMK)
    - Refactored away a ton of needless complexity from the
      older-style tests inherited from the CSV driver (ADAMK)

1.19_05 Thu  2 Apr 2009
    - DBD::SQLite::Amalgamation 3.6.1.2 and DBD::SQLite 1.19
      should be feature identical now.
    - Added collations from DBD::SQLite::Amalgamation (CORION)
    - Removed statement handle activation after "execute" if
      there's no row to fetch. I hope this silences the
      Class::DBI's warnings. (ISHIGAKI)

1.16 abandoned

1.15 abandoned

1.14
    - Updated to SQLite 3.4.2
    - Switch to sqlite3_prepare_v2 which fixes a number of bugs
      with re-using statements
    - Fix bug with overflowing integers in user defined functions
    - Fix bug when building under no-threads perl

1.13
	- A number of bug fixes from RT.
	- Support named bind parameters

1.12
	- Brought up to date with SQLite 3.3.5

1.11
    - Make blobs work transparently (without SQLBLOB binding)

1.10
    - Fix Unicode support (DOMQ)
    - Support usleep on all Linux (inc. debian) (DOMQ)
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.2.7
    - Document how to use BLOBS

1.09
    - Support external SQLite library (rjray)
    - Don't convert things that look like numbers to numbers unless
      specifically requested.
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.2.2

1.08
    - Support 64 bit integers (uses floating point numbers when perl is not 
        compiled with 64 bit int support). This also fixes issues with using
        sqlite timestamps.
    - Upgrade to sqlite 3.1.3
    - Fix issues of not finding rows when providing a number that perl sees as
        a string.
    - Fixes for most current bugs in RT (see http://rt.cpan.org/ to check if your
      favourite bug got fixed).
    
1.07
    - Fix for a memory leak (spotted by Joel Noble)
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.8 (fixes bug on Solaris-sparc)

1.06
    - Resolve symbol conflicts on mac os x.
    - Fix define in WriteMakefile lacking space.
    - Fix DBI prereq in Makefile.PL
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.7

1.05
    - Enabled HAVE_USLEEP where available which should massively
      improve concurrent usage of DBD::SQLite
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.6

1.04
    - Patched to make it compile on Windows (Steve Hay)
    - Fetch next row at end of DBI's fetch() so that one-row
      selects don't need to call ->finish(). This restores DBD::SQLite
      0.31's behaviour (and should make popfile work again)
    - last_insert_id will only work on DBI 1.43, so enforce that
    - Use snprintf from sqlite library to improve portability

1.03
    - Update to sqlite 3.0.4
    - More bug fixes
    - Don't hang forever when db is BUSY
    - Make trace macro work where vararg macros don't

    - Aliases for perl_call_*

      internally.

0.26
    - Update to sqlite 2.8.5
    - Automatic binary encoding added (via a flag)
    - Better getsqlite.pl - now deals with new files
    - Extension functions and aggregates can be created in
      perl space now.

0.25
    - Fixed Makefile.PL to no longer try creating a .c file to determine
      the OS ptrsize - use Config.pm directly in the DEFINE
    - Major updates from Tim Bunce to bring DBD::SQLite in line with
      the DBI spec and other drivers, including:
      - Support for table_info_all() and primary_key_info()

      - execute() returns number of rows updated
      - $dbh->{sqlite_version} returns the SQLite version in use
      - $dbh->{sqlite_encoding} returns the SQLite encoding in use
      - Improved trace debugging
      - Improved error handling

      different endian architectures.

0.18
    - Upgraded to SQLite 2.5.6 - All users are advised to upgrade
      due to a corruption bug in SQLite 2.4.0 - 2.5.6

    - Added script to download sqlite core library when it's upgraded

0.12
    - Upgraded to SQLite 2.4.2

      functions, performance, and even sheds some weight
    - Changed transaction support to only BEGIN TRAN when you execute some
      SQL, which should improve locking problems.

0.10
    - Fixed missing SQLiteXS.h from 0.09

0.09
    - Updated to SQLite 2.3.3, and some file cleanups to make that easier
      next time.
